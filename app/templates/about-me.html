		<h1>About me</h1>
		<h2>I have worked as a developer since 2004 in several different business including start-ups, government agencies, marketing, research, independent professionals and lately companies socially concerned that give back to the community, at a local and international level in M&eacute;xico and the United States. This has given me the experience to provide the organizations with whom I collaborate with the right technological advice.
		<br><br>
		Because technology is always evolving I try to be at the top of my game, that's why I'm always learning new tools and patterns, such as swift which I'm getting pretty good at it.
		<br><br>
		Currently working with IBM as a Lead Front End Engineer with a team of professional developers dedicated to build the nex generation of online banking.</h2>
